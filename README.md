## What is it?

This project is an attempt to port the REV Driver Hub to iOS.

Currently the REV Driver Hub is only written for Android (Natively by REV) and for Desktop (FTC Tui by [FIRST Slovenia](https://firstslo.si/)). I decided, part for functionality and part as a learning challenge, to port the Driver Hub to iOS as well (and coincidentally also to iPadOS).

It only uses native Swift code and no outside code/libraries, except for those provided by Apple themselves.

## Misc. Info
The XCode project is targeting iOS 17.6, although it should be able to run on older versions of iOS.

Hopefully one day when I actually purchase a developer license for Apple, I can get this on the App Store. In the meantime, you can sideload it.

The base code was taked from FTC Tui, since it's open source and then adapted for Swift.

## Legal Stuff
This project is not affiliated with REV Robotics or FIRST. It is simply a community-made project to bring the REV Driver Hub to iOS.
